# üí° Key Gatsby Concepts

There are two main types of React components in a Gatsby site.
1. Page Components
2. ‚Äúbuilding-block‚Äù components.


## 1. __page components__
    
__Key React Concept: Writing a React component__

`my-component.js`
```js
// Step 1: Import React. This lets you use JSX inside your .js file.
import * as React from 'react'

/* Step 2: Define your component. Note that your
component name should start with a capital letter. */
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
      <h1>Hi, welcome to my site!</h1>
  )
}

/* Step 3: Export your component so it
can be used by other parts of your app. */
export default MyComponent
```

- Gatsby automatically creates pages for React components that are the default export of files in the `src/pages` directory.

- If a user tries to visit the URL for a page that doesn‚Äôt actually exist, Gatsby will use the `src/pages/404.js` page component to display an error instead. 

- Pages created in the `src/pages` directory use the name of the file as the route for the page.

- For example, if you had a file called `src/pages/about.js`, you could access that page at `localhost:8000/about`.

- You can use the [Gatsby Head API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-head/) by exporting a named function called `Head` in your pages and page templates (e.g. the ones used by `createPage` or the File System Route API).

  Be sure to capitalize `Head` and please note that exporting this named function inside a component like `Layout` won‚Äôt add the metadata to the `<head>`. The above works because you‚Äôre exporting `Head` in a page inside `src/pages`.

  You can add any valid `<head>` tags inside the function and they‚Äôll be added to the page, for example:

  ```js
  export const Head = () => (
    <>
      <title>About Me</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your description" />
    </>
  )
  ```

## 2. __‚Äúbuilding-block‚Äù components__
    
__Key React Concept: Components with props__

`src/components/greeting.js`
```js
// Defining the <Greeting> component
/* Use 
  <div>
    <Greeting name="Octocat">
    <Greeting name="Moby Dock">
    <Greeting name="Larry">
    <Greeting name="Bugdroid">
  </div>
*/
const Greeting = (props) => {
  return (
    <p>Hi {props.name}!</p>
  )
}
```

- The `Link` component is an example of a __pre-built__ component that you can use in your site.

- The Gatsby `Link` component provides a performance feature called __preloading__. This means that the resources for the linked page are requested when the link scrolls into view or when the mouse hovers on it. That way, when the user actually clicks on the link, the new page can load super quickly.

- Use the `Link` component for linking between pages within your site. For external links to pages not created by your Gatsby site, use the regular HTML `<a>` tag.

## Create resuable components

__Key React Concept: Components with children__
- In addition to the props that you can add to your components, React also creates certain props for your components automatically.

  One such prop is called `children`. When you render a component, the `children` prop will automatically be passed whatever content comes between the opening and closing tags for that component. This is helpful when you want to create a component that wraps some generic content.

`src/pages/gallery.js`

```js
import React from 'react'
import Frame from '../components/frame'

const GalleryPage = () => {
return (
    <Frame>
    <p>This will be passed in as children</p>
    </Frame>
)
}

export default GalleryPage
```

`src/components/frame.js`

```js
import React from 'react'

const Frame = ({ children }) => {
return (
    <div>
    <h1>This is the page title</h1>
    { children }
    </div>
)
}

export default Frame
```

Actual DOM elements will look something like this
```HTML
<div>
    <h1>This is the page title</h1>
    <p>This will be passed in as children</p>
</div>
```

## Style components with **CSS Modules**

With **CSS Modules** to style components the styles are scoped to components, which helps avoid class naming collisions between components. Gatsby is automatically configured to handle CSS Modules - no extra setup necessary!

__Key Styling Concept: CSS Modules__

- To define styles using CSS Modules, put your CSS in a file that ends with the file extension `.module.css`. This tells Gatsby that this CSS file should be processed as a CSS Module rather than plain CSS.

  Within your CSS file, create separate CSS classes for each element you want to style. For example:

  `src/components/my-component.module.css`

  ```css
  .title {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 3rem;
  }
  ```

  Then, in your component `.js` file, import each class separately and apply it to the corresponding React element:

  `src/components/my-component.js`

  ```js
  import * as React from 'react'
  import { title } from './my-component.module.css'

  const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
      <h1 className={title}>
        Super Sweet Title Page
      </h1>
    )
  }

  export default MyComponent
  ```

- If you open the developer console in your web browser and inspect the `<h1>` element, you‚Äôll see that it has a long classname like `my-component-module---title---2lRF7`. That‚Äôs the class name generated by CSS Modules. It‚Äôs guaranteed to be unique across your site, even if you have another component that also has a `.title` class in its `.module.css` file. That‚Äôs one of the reasons CSS Modules are a popular styling approach: they let you write CSS that‚Äôs scoped to your components, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about selector name collisions between components.

## Add Features with Gatsby plugins

- Quickly add new functionality to your site without needing to build it from scratch yourself
- Use [Gatsby Plugin Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins) to browse all available plugins.
- A __plugin__ is a separate npm package that you install to add extra features to your site.

__Key Gatsby Concept: Adding a plugin to your site__

1. __Install__ the plugin using npm.

    This will add the pluginas a dependency in your `package.json` and `package.lock.json` files.

    Depending on what plugin you‚Äôre using, there might be more dependencies that you also need to install. Check the specific plugin‚Äôs README in the plugin library for more details.

    ```bash
    npm install plugin-name
    ```
2. __Configure__ the plugin in your site‚Äôs `gatsby-config.js` file.
   
    ```js
    module.exports = {
      siteMetadata: {
        title: "My First Gatsby Site",
      },
      plugins: ["plugin-name"],
    };
    ```

    Some plugins require extra configuration options. In that case, you‚Äôll add an object to the plugins array (instead of a string)

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      siteMetadata: {
        title: "My First Gatsby Site",
      },
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: "plugin-name",
          options: {
            // Check the plugin README for what options go in here
          }
        },
      ]
    }
    ```

    >Note: After you make updates to your gatsby-config.js file, you‚Äôll need to restart your gatsby develop process for your changes to be picked up.

3. __Use__ the plugin features in your site, as needed.

    - Now that you‚Äôve set up the plugin, you can use it in your Gatsby site as needed. 
    
      The specifics of this step will be different based on what the plugin does. Sometimes, the plugin might have a component or function that you can import and use in your site. Other times, you might not need to do anything extra at all. Check the plugin‚Äôs README for more details.
    
    - import components * When needed, depending on plugin; check the README.
    
      ```js
      import React from "react"
      import * from "gatsby-plugin-name"
      ...
      ```

__Key Gatsby Concept üí°__

The `gatsby-config.js` file is a special file that Gatsby recognizes automatically. It‚Äôs where you add plugins and other site configuration.

After you update your `gatsby-config.js` file, your local development server has to restart in order to pick up the new changes. Sometimes it will restart itself automatically, but if you‚Äôre seeing unexpected behavior, try stopping and restarting it yourself.
