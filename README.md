If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/mechdeveloper/blog) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Remote - Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

## üöÄ Quick start, run locally
1.  **Cone repo and install npm packages**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mechdeveloper/blog.git
    cd blog
    npm install
    ```

    > Note: This project uses VSCode devcontainer, It is recommended to clone this repo on WSL and Reopen the project folder in a Dev Container (Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...). For more details checkout [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```
    gatsby develop
    ```

    If you donot have installed gatsby cli globally, use following command to start development server
    
    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    - Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000 
    - View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and
schema at http://localhost:8000/___graphql

>Tip: If you‚Äôre seeing unexpected behavior (like maybe your local development server isn‚Äôt picking up your new changes), you can run `gatsby clean` from the command line to delete the cache and start fresh on your next build. <br> <br>Don‚Äôt have the Gatsby CLI globally installed? Try running `npx gatsby clean` instead.
